    <h3>Week Two</h3>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Crazy Eights:</b> </p>
    <p>Activity done in class where we fold creases into an A3 page to create 8 grids.
        <br> A timer is then set, and the wireframe sketching begins. One minute per grid!
    </p>

    <p>At the end of this activity, class work was moved and stuck up onto a wall, 
        <br>where we were then expected to elaborate and expand on our ideas.</p>

    <br>

    <p> <b>Paper Prototyping:</b> </p>
    <p> Oh! Surprise, my paper prototyping looks so different to the ideas I'd created in Crazy Eights.
        <br> For the final activity of this week's class, we were assigned the task of mapping out 
        <br> our wireframes and really digging into a design that we would like to fabricate.
        <br> We were given templates to work off from, in the formats of both webpage & mobile.
    </p>

    <p>I was inspired heavily by the creativity of all my peers. 
        <br>Instead of focusing on a simply "aesthetically pleasing" (but perhaps boring) website,
    <br> I decided that I would try something a little more humble and humorous!
    <br> Especially as I am less fluent with all the intricacies of coding language,
    <br> I wanted to focus on creating something that would keep my engagement, and allow me to have a little fun.</p>

    <p><b>Personal Notes & Takeaways:</b></p>
    <p>~What to add to workbook/visual diary/online journal/process documentation?
       <br>~> interactivities, e.g. the gestures activity as well as the tags actitivity from week 1
       <br>~> inspiration: designer, their work, images, etc. 
       <br>~> website will present like an indesign waypost - double spreads and with the capability of being printed 
       <br>~> when it comes to finding information, construct the navigation fot he webstie to be more instinctual and less obvious
