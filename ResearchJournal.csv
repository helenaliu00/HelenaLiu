Based in berlin, they collaborate with a network across the globe, oscillating between commercial and cultural projects of varying scales. I believe that this reference is valuable in the creation of an interactive website (2A), as there are many creative elements in their design. Their use of gifs and small animations is very effective in advertising the qualities of their typefaces and retaining viewer's attention.",Journal_Images/ABC_Dinamo_Foundry_1.png,,"ABC Dinamo Type Foundry, Home Page, 2020",2018,"Home.

left,Can't Help Myself,Sun Yuan and Peng Yu,"""In this work commissioned for the Guggenheim Museum, Sun Yuan & Peng Yu employ an industrial robot, visual-recognition sensors, and software systems to examine the increasingly automated global reality. Placed behind clear acrylic walls, the robot has one specific duty, to contain a viscous, deep-red liquid within a predetermined area. When the sensors detect that the fluid has strayed too far, the arm frenetically shovels it back into place."" This installation is extremely thought-provoking and promotes an extremely creative way of analysing the interactivity between human and machines, inspiring elements of projects in 2C.",Journal_Images/Cant_Help_Myself.jpg,,Can't Help Myself Exhibition Information,2016,"Sun Yuan and Peng Yu | Can’t Help Myself.

leftDoubleImage,Magic Cat Academy,Google Doodle,"This is an annually featured google doodle minigame. Players control a magical cat named Momo through her school adventure. She combats ghosts and bosses across five levels set in different school areas. Ghosts are defeated by mouse clicks and swipes matching symbols above them. Swipes can be horizontal, vertical, ""v"" or ""?"" shaped, and a lightning bolt that weakens enemies. A heart-shaped swipe occasionally restores health. I think that this is a great example of 2B gaming interactivity that is very simple in concept, yet still engaging.

The foundry feaures mainly decorative and dominant fonts. I personally really enjoy the way they've laid out the website - it's not only aesthetically pleasing, but very easy to navigate, all the while being able to put emphasis on their type products effectively. This is definitely a source of inspiration for laying out the structure of a website in 2A.",Journal_Images/OHNO_Foundry.png,,OHNO Type Foundary Home Page,2015,"OH no Type Company. (n.d.).

leftDoubleImage,Pangram Foundry,Mathieu Desjardins," Pangram Pangram gives free access to quality fonts to everyone for personal use. Licenses are available to purchase for commercial projects. The idea is to allow those who use typefaces the most (designers) to play and work with the free fonts in their entirety before deciding to purchase them if they become selected for suitable commerical purposes. Not only is this a great resource for finding fonts in general, I also find its website design (2A) to be incredibly engaging due to the use of very fluid scrolling and gallery animations.

I feel that this is a good representation of 2B coursework, and can be replicable in P5js. It also captures the spirit of fun and nonsense, inspiring the ability to think creatively about how elements can be controlled by actions other than a finger tap or mouse click.

leftDoubleImage,SF Symphony,COLLINS Design,"This is an example of a logo created by Collins Design. It is a rebranding of the San Franciso Symphony Orchestra. The logo was created through a collaboration with musicians, audiences, staff, and leaders. It focuses on digital, sonic, and typographic experiments, creating a responsive visual system. Collins blend traditional typography with variable fonts that react to sound, adding contemporary flair. I think that this reference is valuable when it comes to establishing smart design and stylistic choices, throughout all three modules, but mainly focusing on 2A & 2B. The use of sound design and animation is also very tasteful and well-done.

left,The Evolution of Trust,Nicky Case,"In 2017, Case released the interactive presentation The Evolution of Trust. In an attempt to explain the Christmas truce and the rise of mistrust in modern society, The Evolution of Trust uses a prisoner's dilemma–like thought experiment. As the presentation goes on, most optimal play styles to the experiment are discussed, and the experiment is expanded upon to include factors like human mistakes and repeated interactions. I think that this website is a great example of using simple html, css and javascript to create an engaging presentation, relating to t2A. The website design is also generally very cute, and the information and formatting of the text is easy to follow along.
