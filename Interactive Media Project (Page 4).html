    <p> <b>Make it Bling</b> </p>
    <p>Adding in more interactive elements, sharing code snippets, 
    <br> and receiving feedback on our website structures and functionality.
    <br> Adding in my work-in-progress:
    </p>

    <img src="Images/4 Draft.jpeg" height="400" title="Crazy Eights!"></a>

    <p>Originally I had wanted for my icons to be dropped over the table in order for the links to open, 
        <br>however, due to time constraints, as well as the limitations of my coding,
        <br>I chose to leave it temporarily as simple, clickable items.</p>
    <br>

    <p> <b>Fluid Design:</b> </p>
    <p> Breaking down elements of our websites into basic building blocks so that we are able to 
        <br> better understand and restructure it. 
        <br> Essentially, I focused on constructing the digitally-drawn elements
        <br> and images that make up the icons of my website. Such icons include:
    </p>

    <div class="gallery3">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/Cat_Element.PNG" alt="Image 1">
            <p>~Chonky Grey~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/Table_Element.PNG" alt="Image 2">
            <p>~Chonky Table~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/WK1_Icon.PNG" alt="Image 3">
            <p>~Fuzzy Wool~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/WK2_Icon.PNG" alt="Image 4">
            <p>~Wet Glass~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/WK3_Icon.PNG" alt="Image 4">
            <p>~Fancy 中国~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/WK4_Icon.PNG" alt="Image 4">
            <p>~Pot.~</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>As shown, my concept is simple. I really adore cats, and the joys of simplistic but fun stylised layout.
        <br>The interactive elements will all be cat-themed, with the homepage being a nod to the stereotypical 
        <br>behaviour expected of a cat - to push random things off a table. My website will attempt to draw out
        <br>the natural curiosity in all of us, while presenting all information in a clear, instinctive way.
    </p>

    <p><b>Personal Notes & Takeaways:</b></p>
    <p>~This week I was away, and thus don't have as much to add.
        <br>~Don't ask me what I'm going to do in the next assignment once I run out of space for more icons on the table...
        <br>~I don't want to touch Javascript with a ten-foot-pole at the moment. (That's not to say I won't try anyways.)
        <br>~Lots of bugfixing was required with positioning the image of the cat on the table
        <br>~Several times, I realised that some of my links were not working due to object arrangement,
        <br>therefore motivating me to learn about the "y-index" elements in CSS.
        <br>~I still want to improve on my choice of fonts, as well as the overall layout of the website (box, grid, etc.)
        <br>~Added a hamburger menu for ease of navigation.
        <br>~Added sound video elements
    </p>
